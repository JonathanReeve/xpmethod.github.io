<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

How does technology affect the ways in which we think of ourselves, talk to
each other, and make decisions? Projects in this research cluster engage in
the critical examination of ideas at the core of deliberative democracy:
freedom of speech, participatory culture, and collective memory. These
theoretical concerns manifest in the applied mechanisms of governance and
citizenship, contesting, in practice, our commitment to the politics of
privacy or surveillance, secrecy or transparency, preservation (as in the duty
to remember) or entropy (as in, the right to be forgotten). Our (NYC-based)
proximity to the worlds of journalism, library science, and publishing gives
us an opportunity to affect meaningful change in redressing inequalities of
access, to envision the **future of books and literacy**, and to experiment
with new modes and new forums for discussion and communication.
