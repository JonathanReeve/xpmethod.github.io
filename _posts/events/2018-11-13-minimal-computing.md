## The course

Have you ever been interested in publishing a small archive of manuscripts, art, photographs or other primary sources on the web? Interested in learning about digital humanities? Have you ever wanted to create your own web project from scratch? In this 4 part course, and a bonus round, you will learn how to build a web project that catalogues and presents digitized cultural artifacts using Wax, a set of minimal computing approaches developed at Columbia University. Minimal computing, broadly defined, refers to computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors. Wax is a flexible framework and set of tools that allow you to create eminently durable and useful digital archives without a database. To see an example of Wax in action you can visit the Style Revolution (https://stylerevolution.github.io/) built by graduate students in Art History or the Barbara Curtis Adachi Bunraku Collection (https://bunraku.library.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University Libraries.
