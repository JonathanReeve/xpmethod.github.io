**Columbia University Libraries** & **Columbiaâ€™s Group for Experimental
Methods in the Humanities** invites you to a Puerto Rico Mapathon
for relief efforts.

Come help with relief efforts on the ground in Puerto Rico by contributing
your time to open-source mapping.

No mapping experience necessary. No knowledge of local terrain is necessary.
Come any time during the afternoon. This [short video](https://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/) can introduce you to the OSM mapping work

Please bring your laptop & RSVP to agil@columbia.edu

Since we announced our event on the weekend, we have been delighted to see other universities/teams follow our lead. Added to our event, we feel this can have a real impact on ground operations. Universities running mapathons so far:

- [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/disc/2017/09/26/disaster-relief-mapathon/)
- University of Omaha
- Rutgers University
- University of Miami
- Trinity College

We are working on a toolkit with these teams that we hope to share with other teams looking to replicate our model in the future. Stay tuned.
