Since we announced our event on the weekend, we have been delighted to see other universities/teams follow our lead. Added to our event, we feel this can have a real impact on ground operations. Universities running mapathons so far:

- [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/disc/2017/09/26/disaster-relief-mapathon/)
- University of Omaha
- Rutgers University
- University of Miami
- Trinity College

We are working on a toolkit with these teams that we hope to share with other teams looking to replicate our model in the future. Stay tuned.
