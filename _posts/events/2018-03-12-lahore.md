## Rationale

What role do archives play in the making of knowledge? How are infrastructures
of power, prestige, and access built in and around archives-- physical and
digital? *Knowledge Architectures: Lahore* is the continuation of a
long-standing intellectual concern of our Lab. We aim to think about the
relationship between knowledge, physical archives, practices of
mass-digitization, accessibility of digital repositories to scholars and
activists across boundaries, and the power to re-think, re-mix and re-use
cultural heritage. Our goals are always to argue for un-fettered access
irrespective of devices or skills. We aim to empower communities to construct
and re-think archival practices in frameworks true to their ethical and
political selves.
