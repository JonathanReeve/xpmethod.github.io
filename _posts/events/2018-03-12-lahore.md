## Rationale

What role do archives play in the making of knowledge? How are infrastructures of power, prestige, and access built in and around archives-- physical and digital? *Knowledge Architectures: Lahore* is the continuation of a long-standing intellectual concern of our Lab. We aim to think about the relationship between knowledge, physical archives, practices of mass-digitization, accessibility of digital repositories to scholars and activists across boundaries, and the power to re-think, re-mix and re-use cultural heritage. Our goals are always to argue for un-fettered access irrespective of devices or skills. We aim to empower communities to construct and re-think archival practices in frameworks true to their ethical and political selves. 

In 2016, we convened [in Mumbai](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/events/dissent.html). Our Workshop in Lahore will build on that. We bring together scholars, activists, artists to think constructively and thoroughly about such paradigms of colonial knowledge production, national and local archival practices and the role of the citizen-artist in claiming their own pasts. We look forward to the conversation.
