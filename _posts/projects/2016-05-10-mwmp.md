We aim to create a data-rich digital repository of rare manuscripts from the
Muslim world in the holdings at Columbia University. The archive will engage
critically with questions of access, marginality, scholarly and enthusiast
collecting, and related issues. It will build on some of the work undertaken by
the Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities at their Mumbai meeting on
[free archives and shadow
libraries](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/technologies-of-dissent/digital-justice.html). 

### Collection Details

There is a substantial collection of Muslim-world manuscripts housed at
Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscripts Library (RBML), as well as in some other
affiliated institutions (i.e., the Burke Library). These manuscripts are in
Perso-Arabic or related scripts. Though part of the University's collection,
these manuscripts constitute a "dark" archive, for they are either uncatalogued
or only partially catalogued. An Excel spreadsheet, created from
a thirty-year-old card catalog, serves as the current finding aid for this
collection.

The collection can be subdivided into six groups: 

1. **Smith & Plimpton Collection** Some 600 boxes containing manuscripts. Around 1200 manuscripts deal with "mathematics". David Eugene Smith was a professor of Mathematics at Teachers College, Columbia University (1901-1923). He collected mathematics manuscripts, and his whole collection is held at RBML. Plimpton was a manuscript collector mainly interested in educational manuscripts.
2. **Jeffery Collection** A collection of Qur'anic manuscripts, roughly 50. Arthur Jeffery was a professor of Semitic Languages at Columbia University and the Union Theological Seminary. 
3. **X Manuscript Collection** Purchased by or gifted to RBML since the 1930s, most of which are bound books. There are roughly 179 manuscripts, most of which have been poorly catalogued with widely diverging systems of transliteration.
4. **Persian Lithograph Collection** This includes (but is not limited to) Saeed Nafisi's library, purchased in 1960s. The collection is dispersed throughout Butler's shelves, offsite storage, or at RBML itself. Saeed Nafisi was a renowned poet, translator and professor of Persian literature in early-twentieth-century Iran.
5. **The Arabic Papyri Collection** RBML is in possession of an undisclosed papyri collection, which requires investigation and cataloguing.
6. **The Burke Collection** A set of 26 manuscripts in Arabic script. They were probably collected by the missionaries connected to the Union Theological Seminary.

### Aims of the MWMP

* To create a unified catalog for all of these collections, available via the library and RBML finding aids.
* To digitize the approximately 150,000 manuscript pages and make them available for wider scholarly consumption.

### Plan of Action

* Summer 2016: Begin collating current data and considering metadata issues
* Fall 2016: Acquire funding streams. Begin data input. Hold a public conference, "Forgotten Collections: Cataloguing Islamic Manuscript Collections of Columbia University," with leading archivists, scholars and material culture experts.
* Winter 2016: Create a front-end for the collection.

### Funding

Current modest funding (~ \$5,000) has been acquired from the Middle East
Institute, Global Studies, Professor Sheldon Pollock and the Center for
International History. We are looking from funding from within the library as
well as outside it.
