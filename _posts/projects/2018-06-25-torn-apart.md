In response to the United States government's new policy to officially
separate families at the border, we are designing an interactive map locating
detention centers, border cross-points where arrests are happening and allied
centers. We hope this map can be useful to activists, immigration workers, and
other allies. In addition we hope the map can help inform parts of the general
public and help us remain focused on these separations until we stop the US
government from perpetrating these horrors on families.

Torn Apart is part of our Mobilized Humanities interventions. MH brings
together digital tools to equip broad social awareness and help in global
critical situations. We mobilize humanities faculties, libraries, and students
with relevant language, archival, technical, and social expertise to nimbly
produce curated and applied knowledge. MH sits away from state and
non-governmental organizations and is scholarly activism in a global context.

Torn Part is a rapidly deployed critical data & visualization intervention in
the USA’s 2018 “Zero Tolerance Policy” for asylum seekers at the US Ports of
Entry and the humanitarian crisis that has followed.

## Data

We began with ICE/CBP websites and got the public geo-data that they serve. We
then began looking into business records, federal records, and news records
culling data about locations used by federal, state, and private for-profit
agencies. Simultaneously, we were assembling data about “Allies”– those
working to resist, assist, or alleviate this crisis. However, our largest data
tranche came via our discovery of the “[November 2017 ICE Detention Facility
Lists][1]” , which exists because of the FOIA efforts of the Immigrant Legal
Resource Center and the National Immigrant Justice Center. Our visualizations
thus combine these sets of data. We are extremely grateful to ILRC and NIJC
for making the ICE data publicly available. Our full sources of data are in
the bibliography.
