### About

Knowledge Architectures is a series of workshops that brings together
activists, scholars, artists, and librarians concerned with global
inequalities facing knowledge work. These manifest in the aggregation of
material and scientific archives in northern Europe and America; the pay-walls
constructed by the corporate publishing industry; and the amassing of digital
labor in the Global South while the prestige economy remains in the Global
North. Together, we will investigate technological and artistic practices of
epistemic action, build alliances across borders and economies, share notes,
and outline possibilities for further concerted action.
