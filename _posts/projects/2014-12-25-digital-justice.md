Over the past two years, a number of key conversations, workshops and events
at Columbia have delved into expanding and embedding digital humanities among
faculty and students. In the History, English, Computer Science departments
and the Library, workshops have introduced or trained participants and
embarked on direct collaboration with faculty research projects. A key
intellectual concern arising out of these meetings is to interrogate the
territorial and conceptual space of the digital humanities vis-à-vis justice.
How do fundamental concerns of humanistic scholarship—gender, race,
inequality, law, ethics—intersect and inhabit the techniques, tools and
methods of digital humanities? What means are present to integrate the global
perspective—the inclusion of distinct and diverse voices and realities—with
the universalism that often pervades the field of digital humanities.

More than half of the world’s population accesses the internet through a
mobile phone. And yet, much of the academic practice in digital humanities and
computational social sciences is aimed at bandwidth-heavy, visually
complicated, high-performance vision of knowledge production. Embraced by
eco-modders and by members of the GO::DH community alike, minimal computing is
not just a model for the “developing world.” It offers all the possibility of
human technology, less shiny and more chaotic perhaps than big data or 3-D
graphics, but also, in contrast, universally accessible, hackable, lasting,
portable, and empowered.

### Free Archives & Shadow Libraries

Responding to President Bollinger's call to expand the campus conversation
about Equal Justice, this proposal, *Architectures of Knowledge*, harnesses the
emerging field of Digital Humanities towards critically engaging with
questions of digital publics, epistemic regimes, and knowledge architectures.
To these ends, we have organized an international meeting of researchers,
librarians, and activists that addresses equitable distribution of information
globally.  Events held in Mumbai, India July 4th-6th. Organized by Columbia
University in cooperation with Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, Center for
International History, TISS, Leuphana University, CAMP, Multimedia Institute,
and others.

We are inviting you to participate in a two day workshop at TISS Mumbai to be
held July 4-6th, 2016. The workshop will bring together activists, scholars,
artists, and librarians concerned with global inequalities facing knowledge
work. These manifest in the aggregation of material and scientific archives in
northern Europe and America; the pay-walls constructed by the corporate
publishing industry; and the amassing of digital labor in the Global South
while the prestige economy remains in the Global North. In this meeting, we
will investigate technological and artistic practices of epistemic action,
build alliances across borders and economies, share notes, and outline
possibilities for further concerted action.

### Organizational detail:
