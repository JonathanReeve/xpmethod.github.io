Outcaste Press is the first international Dalit Feminist press committed to
promoting anti-caste thought worldwide and to bringing global attention to
Dalit women.

Rooted in the thought of Dr. B.R Ambedkar and the radical feminism of Jyotiba
and Savitribai Phule, the objective of the Press is to shed light on the
struggles of India's marginalized groups.

Our objective is to democratize the reading cultures in India and to bring
diversity in women’s writing. We are interested in furthering critical debates
around gender, participatory democracy, socio-political and economic
inequalities, culture, and difference. Our vision is to become a catalyst of
social transformation: to educate, organize, and agitate for a more equitable
India. To these ends we are soliciting academic monographs, collections of
essays, fiction, non-fiction, and work in translation.

## Seal

The seal of Outcaste Press uses original artwork from Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s
newspaper, "Bahishkrut Bharat" (Ostracized India) 3rd April, 1927.

Besides being the chief architect of India's Constitution, Ambedkar had a
prolific career as a publisher, working to establish the autonomous voice of
the untouchables.
