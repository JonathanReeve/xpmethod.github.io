<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

We are a group of literary scholars, sociologists of knowledge, and
information designers interested in experimenting with distant reading,
lateral reading, cultural analytics, digital philology, micro- and
macro-analysis, and textual trans-mediation. We believe that the humanities
are not just a set of values or theories, they offer a way of enacting change
in the world: from the creation of taxonomies, to knowledge design, material
history, and large-scale text analysis. This research cluster therefore
showcases **new research methods**, which complement traditional practices of
deep thought and contextual reflection with a robust sense of making and
doing.
