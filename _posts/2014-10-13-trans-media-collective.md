Media become palpable in transmission, as when, for example, an audio signal
is transformed from sound waves into electromagnetic pulse for digital
storage. This research cluster concerns the material conditions of media
production, reception, and dissemination. We are media theorists, archivists,
practitioners, and historians interested in making good on the metaphor of
media 'archaeology.' Archaeology, in its literal sense, reveals **platforms
and infrastructures** that support cultural practice. To recover the object in
its critical-theoretical figuration is to encounter it also as an **epistemic
thing** and to recreate, experimentally, devices and techniques that brought
it into existence. Moderated by Professor [Durba Mitra][db], Studies of Women,
Gender, and Sexuality (Harvard).
