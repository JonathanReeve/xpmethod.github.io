<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

Walking can be a mode of analysis that extends body through space. The
Embodied Space Lab incorporates mobile methods of reading and map-making into
philology and historiography. In the dialectic between body and space we trace
apparent vectors of power, technology, gender, class, and ethnicity. We
draw critical cartographies: ways of seeing and reflecting on an embodied and
embedded world.
