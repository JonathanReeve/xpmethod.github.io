<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

As scholars, students, and archivists, we would like to imagine---study,
build---**knowledge architectures** that answer to humanistic ideals. Our
proximity to the worlds of journalism, library science, and publishing gives
us an opportunity to affect meaningful change in redressing inequalities of
access, to envision the future of books and literacy, and to experiment with
new modalities of human--text interaction. Moderated by [Alex Gil][ag] and
[Jeremiah Christensen][jc], Butler Library (Columbia University).
