<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

More than half of the world's population accesses the internet through a
mobile phone. And yet, much of academic practice in digital humanities and
computational social sciences is aimed at bandwidth-heavy, visually
complicated, high-performance vision of knowledge production. Inspired by
principles of **minimal computing**, we would like to experiment---study,
imagine, build---**knowledge architectures** that answer to humanistic ideals:
local, contextually aware, historically rich, universally accessible,
hackable, sustainable, empowered, fair, and just. We ask: How does technology
affect the ways in which we think of ourselves, talk to each other, and make
decisions? Projects in this research cluster engage in the critical
examination of ideas at the core of deliberative democracy: freedom of speech,
participatory culture, and collective memory. These theoretical concerns
manifest in the applied mechanisms of governance and citizenship, contesting,
in practice, our commitment to the politics of privacy or surveillance,
secrecy or transparency, preservation (as in the duty to remember) or entropy
(as in, the right to be forgotten). Our (NYC-based) proximity to the worlds of
journalism, library science, and publishing gives us an opportunity to affect
meaningful change in redressing inequalities of access, to envision the
**future of books and literacy**, and to experiment with new modalities of
human-computer-human interaction.
