<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

More than half of the world's population accesses the internet through a
mobile phone. Yet, much of academic practice in digital humanities and
computational social sciences is aimed at bandwidth-heavy, visually
complicated, high-performance vision of knowledge production. Inspired by
principles of minimal computing, we would like to study and build **knowledge
architectures** that answer to humanistic ideals. Our proximity to the worlds
of journalism, library science, and publishing gives us an opportunity to
affect meaningful change in redressing inequalities of access, to envision the
future of books and literacy, and to experiment with new modalities of
human--text interaction. Moderated by [Alex Gil][ag] and [Jeremiah
Christensen][jc], Butler Library (Columbia University).
