<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

More than half of the world's population accesses the internet through a
mobile phone. And yet, much of academic practice in digital humanities and
computational social sciences is aimed at bandwidth-heavy, visually
complicated, high-performance vision of knowledge production. Inspired by
principles of **minimal computing**, we would like to experiment---study,
imagine, build---**knowledge architectures** that answer to humanistic ideals:
local, contextually aware, historically rich, universally accessible,
hackable, sustainable, empowered, fair, and just.
