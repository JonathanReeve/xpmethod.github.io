What does it mean to "experiment" in the study of history, literature, or
philosophy? In answering that question we draw inspiration from two distinct
spaces. First, the laboratory, where scientists bracket the world in search
for independent variables and reproducible results. Second, the studio, where
artists let the world in: to disrupt rigid modes of perception under
circumstances that are always indeterminate and subjective. In both spaces,
thought is secreted in practice, "on the fetid and throbbing ground of
life."[^LN1]

The Columbia group for experimental methods in the humanities is dedicated to
the **rapid prototyping of speculative ideas**. To this end, we collect,
curate, and publish intermediary artifacts of scholarship: drafts, notes,
graphics, twitter bots, web-protocols, "situations," tools, and tutorials that
take us some way from unstructured thought to accepted knowledge. Some of
these artifacts are presented as is, others will be peer-reviewed (and clearly
marked as such).

Somewhere between a lab experiment and experimental art, we hope to open a
space for process-based scholarship, "to be judged not on its success or
failure, but simply as an act the outcome of which is unknown."[^LN2]
